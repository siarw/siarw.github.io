# Pedro Lacerda's homepage

For the past twenty years, I have been employed in academia in five different countries, doing research in astronomy and astrophysics, and teaching mathematics, physics and astronomy.

Since 2022, I am a member of the Institute of Astrophysics in Portugal, and work with the ESA Space Solutions team at Instituto Pedro Nunes in Coimbra. I am part of the ESA Comet Interceptor science working group.
