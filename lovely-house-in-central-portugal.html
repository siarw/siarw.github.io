  <h1>For sale: Lovely House in a quiet village in central Portugal</h1>
  
  <p>We are selling our lovely house in central Portugal. It is located in a small village between the thermal town of Luso and Mortágua. It is a beautiful, quiet place with great views over the green hills.</p>

  <p></p>The house was completely renovated in 2019 with double glazing throughout. Downstairs is a large open space with kitchen. The room remains wonderfully cool in summer. Two sets of double patio doors open up to the garden. There is also a toilet where the washing machine is located, with a connection for a shower, should this be desired in the future.</p>
  
  <p>The kitchen has a large fridge-freezer, a gas cooker and large oven. Hot water comes from a gas boiler that works with a gas cylinder. Above the sink is a large tilting window overlooking the garden.</p>
  
  <p>During the winter, the house is heated with the fireplace and the heating system connected to it: a hot water tank above the fireplace distributes hot water to radiators throughout the house. Wood can be bought from the neighbour, who delivers it to the house - you can pile it under the stairs outside.</p>
  
  <p>Upstairs, there are two large bedrooms, one of which we use as a workspace (there is fibre-optic internet, works great), and a small room that fits a single bed. There is a bathroom with a spacious shower and two French windows with a view. There is also space in the hall for things like shelves and/or a small table.</p>
  
  <p>The energy label is A, the certificate dates from 2022.</p>
  
  <p>A veranda wraps around the back and side of the house, where you can enjoy a cup of coffee in the morning and listen to the birds. Everything around you is green! You don't hear any traffic; a car passes by maybe three times a day. At night it is dead quiet, you won't hear dogs barking, just the crickets, frogs and owls.</p>
  
  <p>Next to the house is an open shed with shelving units.</p>
  
  <p>The garden is about 750 m2 and has several olive trees (you can harvest the olives and take them to the press and then enjoy your own olive oil!), an apple tree, lemon tree, fig tree, strawberry trees (medronheiros) and grape vines. We made our own small vegetable garden, where we grew tomatoes, courgettes, peppers, various cabbages, broccoli, lettuce and cucumbers. </p>
  
  <p>The village has no café or shops. Two or three times a week the baker drives by, on Tuesdays a fish truck and on Wednesday afternoons a mobile mini market with all sorts of supplies. The sweet and helpful Portuguese villagers regularly leave bags of fruit and vegetables on your doorstep and constantly invite you for a glass of wine (which they make themselves!). A two-minute walk away is a holiday villa with pool owned by a Dutch couple, part of which is rented out to mainly Dutch tourists. Handy for when you don't want/can't have guests in your own house.</p>
  
  <p>We can give you the contact details of the builder who renovated the house, should you want to make any changes. He speaks English.</p>
  
  <p>Luso, which is famous for its water, and Mortágua, where all sorts of events are organised in the summer and where there are several supermarkets, are 10 to 15 minutes' drive away. There are also waterfalls nearby and a large dam/reservoir where you can swim. You can also enjoy hiking in/around the village on the numerous paths that lead everywhere.</p>
  
  <p>The old university city of Coimbra is a 45-minute drive away and the beach is an hour's drive. Porto airport is an hour and a half away. You can also get to Salamanca (Spain) in just three hours.</p>
