# The nucleus of comet 67P

## Unexpected Shape

Some of the first resolved images of comet 67P are out and they are very surprising. Based on interpretation of the comet's light curve, it's nucleus was expected to look like this:

Instead, here is what Rosetta found:

## Shape Model and Landing Site

On 12 November 2014, the Philae probe on board Rosetta will land on comet 67P. Here is a very nice animation by [3DMalmer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf7G99NAZktnI__wHTD9k7A) showing where Philae is planned to land. The primary and backup landing site are marked in blue and red.
